# Feature toggles
Feature toggles are configuration for the application to disable certain functionality on-demand.

## Implementation
Two component is related to feature toggling.

The `<FeatureToggleProvider/>` wraps the application and take care of loading the default configuration when needed.

The `<FeatureToggle>` component is used to wrap features we want to disable, it have a `feature` property to identify what feature we want to connect it to, and an optional `offTemplate` property where we can set JSX we want to render in case the feature is disabled.

## Default configuration
With environment variables there is a way to setup default list of disabled features if needed.

## Testing
Feature toggles are availale at the `/debug` url, where tags can be easily disabled/enabled.
